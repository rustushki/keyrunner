* Windows Compilation Instructions:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


I don't have much experience compiling in Windows.  After much effort and $0 of
investment, I managed to compile KeyRunner with CodeBlocks via MinGW on Windows
XP.  Here are some basic instructions so that it's easier to reproduce:

1. Download and Install CodeBlocks  (http://codeblocks.org; get
'codeblocks-10.05-setup.exe').  Note that there is also a CodeBlocks package
which contains MinGW; I've not tried it yet, but I'll do so soon and update
these instructions.

2. Download and Install MinGW.  I used the mingw-get-inst-20120426.exe package.

3. Download the SDL-devel / MinGW package from libsdl.org.  I used
SDL-devel-1.2.15-mingw32.tar.gz.

4. Unpackage SDL-devel.

5. Copy SDL-devel\lib\* to C:\Program Files\CodeBlocks\lib\ (create a directory if
you need to).

6. Copy SDL-devel\include\SDL  to C:\Program Files\CodeBlocks\include\SDL.

7. Copy SDL-devel\bin\SDL.dll to C:\Windows\.

8. Download SDL_ttf-2.0.11-win32.zip from http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_ttf/.

9. Extract all DLLs from the SDL_ttf package to C:\Windows\.

10. Download SDL_ttf-2.0.11.tar.gz from http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_ttf/.

11. Extract SDL_ttf.h to C:\Program Files\CodeBlocks\include\SDL.

12. Download SDL_image-1.2.12-win32.zip from http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/.

13. Extract all DLLs to C:\Windows\.

14. Download SDL_image-1.2.12.tar.gz from http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/.

15. Extract SDL_image.h to C:\Program Files\CodeBlocks\include\SDL. 

You've now unpacked DLLs and header files for SDL, SDL_ttf, SDL_image, and
libpng (via SDL_image).  You've added the MinGW compiler to your
system.  The CodeBlocks IDE is also installed and will automatically detect
that MinGW is compiled.

16. Extract the KeyRunner Package somewhere.

17. Run CodeBlocks create a new Console Project.  Name it KeyRunner.

18. Add all of KeyRunner's *.h and *.cpp files.

19. Add the img\ and level\ folders.  You will also need to add these to the
Release\ and Debug\ folders.

20. CodeBlocks can now successfully compile the project using the Build
functionality.
